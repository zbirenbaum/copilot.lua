 * The ContextProvider API allows extensions to provide additional context items that

 * and the data structures used by the API.
 *
 * Note: providing context is not enough to ensure that the context will be used in the prompt.
 *
 * The API is exposed as an export of the Copilot extension. To use it, you can cast the
 * exported object to the ContextProviderApiV1 interface.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * const copilot = vscode.extensions.getExtension("github.copilot");
 * const contextProviderAPI = copilot.exports.getContextProviderAPI("v1") as ContextProviderApiV1;
 * ```
