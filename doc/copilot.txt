*copilot.txt*Fully featured & enhanced replacement for copilot.vim complete with API for interacting with Github Copilot

==============================================================================
1. copilot.lua                                           *copilot-copilot.lua*

This plugin is the pure lua replacement for github/copilot.vim
<https://github.com/github/copilot.vim>.

Motivation behind `copilot.lua` ~

While using `copilot.vim`, for the first time since I started using neovim my
laptop began to overheat. Additionally, I found the large chunks of ghost text
moving around my code, and interfering with my existing cmp ghost text
disturbing. As lua is far more efficient and makes things easier to integrate
with modern plugins, this repository was created.

AUTHENTICATION ~

You can authenticate using one of the following methods:

Permanent sign-in (Recommended) ~

Once copilot is running, run `:Copilot auth` to start the authentication
process.

Token (not officially supported) ~

Tokens given by `gh auth token` do not support Copilot, you therefore need to
first generate a token through the LSP by:

- Authenticating using the `Permanent sign-in` method
- Grab the token by running `:Copilot auth info`
- You can then safely delete the `github-copilot` folder created in your NeoVim base data directory.

Set either the environment variable `GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN` or
`GH_COPILOT_TOKEN` to that token. Note that if you have the variable set, even
empty, the LSP will attempt to use it to log in.


AUTHENTICATION WITH ALTERNATE GITHUB INSTANCES

If your access to Copilot is not provided by the public GitHub instance, you
can set your authentication provider to a custom URL with the corresponding
config key e.g. `auth_provider_url = "https://mycorp.ghe.com/"`.


SETUP AND CONFIGURATION          *copilot-copilot.lua-setup-and-configuration*

You have to run the `require("copilot").setup(options)` function in order to
start Copilot. If no options are provided, the defaults are used.

Because the copilot server takes some time to start up, it is recommended that
you lazy load copilot. For example:

>lua
    use {
      "zbirenbaum/copilot.lua",
      cmd = "Copilot",
      event = "InsertEnter",
      config = function()
        require("copilot").setup({})
      end,
    }
<

Default configuration ~

>lua
    require('copilot').setup({
      panel = {
        enabled = true,
        auto_refresh = false,
        keymap = {
          jump_prev = "[[",
          jump_next = "]]",
          accept = "<CR>",
          refresh = "gr",
          open = "<M-CR>"
        },
        layout = {
          position = "bottom", -- | top | left | right | horizontal | vertical
          ratio = 0.4
        },
      },
      suggestion = {

        hgcommit = false,
        svn = false,
        cvs = false,
        ["."] = false,
      },
      auth_provider_url = nil, -- URL to authentication provider, if not "https://github.com/"
      logger = {
        file = vim.fn.stdpath("log") .. "/copilot-lua.log",
        file_log_level = vim.log.levels.OFF,
        print_log_level = vim.log.levels.WARN,
        trace_lsp = "off", -- "off" | "messages" | "verbose"
        trace_lsp_progress = false,
        log_lsp_messages = false,
      },
      copilot_node_command = 'node', -- Node.js version must be > 20
      workspace_folders = {},
      copilot_model = "",  -- Current LSP default is gpt-35-turbo, supports gpt-4o-copilot
      root_dir = function()
        return vim.fs.dirname(vim.fs.find(".git", { upward = true })[1])
      end,
      should_attach = function(_, _)
        if not vim.bo.buflisted then
          logger.debug("not attaching, buffer is not 'buflisted'")
          return false
        end
    
        if vim.bo.buftype ~= "" then
          logger.debug("not attaching, buffer 'buftype' is " .. vim.bo.buftype)
          return false
        end
    
        return true
      end,
      server = {
        type = "nodejs", -- "nodejs" | "binary"
        custom_server_filepath = nil,
      },
      server_opts_overrides = {},
    })
<


PANEL ~

Panel can be used to preview suggestions in a split window. You can run the
`:Copilot panel` command to open it.

If `auto_refresh` is `true`, the suggestions are refreshed as you type in the
buffer.

The `copilot.panel` module exposes the following functions:

>lua
    require("copilot.panel").accept()
    require("copilot.panel").jump_next()
    require("copilot.panel").jump_prev()
    require("copilot.panel").open({position, ratio})
    require("copilot.panel").toggle()
    require("copilot.panel").refresh()
<


SUGGESTION ~

When `auto_trigger` is `true`, copilot starts suggesting as soon as you enter
insert mode. When `auto_trigger` is `false`, use the `next`, `prev` or `accept`
keymap to trigger copilot suggestion. When `trigger_on_accept` is `false`, the
keypress will be passed to the buffer as-is, instead of triggering completion.

To toggle auto trigger for the current buffer, use
`require("copilot.suggestion").toggle_auto_trigger()`.

Copilot suggestion is automatically hidden when `popupmenu-completion` is open.
In case you use a custom menu for completion, you can set the
`copilot_suggestion_hidden` buffer variable to `true` to have the same
behavior.

Example using nvim-cmp ~

>lua
    cmp.event:on("menu_opened", function()
      vim.b.copilot_suggestion_hidden = true
    end)
    
    cmp.event:on("menu_closed", function()
      vim.b.copilot_suggestion_hidden = false
    end)
<

Example using blink.cmp ~

>lua
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
      pattern = "BlinkCmpMenuOpen",
      callback = function()
        vim.b.copilot_suggestion_hidden = true
      end,
    })
    
    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("User", {
      pattern = "BlinkCmpMenuClose",
      callback = function()
        vim.b.copilot_suggestion_hidden = false
      end,
    })
<

The `copilot.suggestion` module exposes the following functions:

>lua
    require("copilot.suggestion").is_visible()
    require("copilot.suggestion").accept(modifier)
    require("copilot.suggestion").accept_word()
    require("copilot.suggestion").accept_line()
    require("copilot.suggestion").next()
    require("copilot.suggestion").prev()
    require("copilot.suggestion").dismiss()
    require("copilot.suggestion").toggle_auto_trigger()
<


FILETYPES ~

Specify filetypes for attaching copilot.

Example:

>lua
    require("copilot").setup {
      filetypes = {
        markdown = true, -- overrides default
        terraform = false, -- disallow specific filetype
        sh = function ()
          if string.match(vim.fs.basename(vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0)), '^%.env.*') then
            -- disable for .env files
            return false
          end
          return true
        end,
      },
    }
<

If you add `"*"` as a filetype, the default configuration for `filetypes`
won’t be used anymore. e.g.

>lua
    require("copilot").setup {
      filetypes = {
        javascript = true, -- allow specific filetype
        typescript = true, -- allow specific filetype
        ["*"] = false, -- disable for all other filetypes and ignore default `filetypes`
      },
    }
<


LOGGER ~

Logs will be written to the `file` for anything of `file_log_level` or higher.
Logs will be printed to NeoVim (using `notify`) for anything of
`print_log_level` or higher. To turn either off, simply set its level to
`vim.log.levels.OFF`. File logging is done asynchronously to minimize
performance impacts, however there is still some overhead.

Log levels used are the ones defined in `vim.log`:

>lua
    vim.log = {
      levels = {
        TRACE = 0,
        DEBUG = 1,
        INFO = 2,
        WARN = 3,
        ERROR = 4,
        OFF = 5,
      },
    }
<

`trace_lsp` controls logging of LSP trace messages (`$/logTrace`) can either
be:

- `off`
- `messages` which will output the LSP messages
- `verbose` which adds additional information to the message.

When `trace_lsp_progress` is true, LSP progress messages (`$/progress`) will
also be logged. When `log_lsp_messages` is true, LSP log messages
(`window/logMessage`) events will be logged.

Careful turning on all logging features as the log files may get very large
over time, and are not pruned by the application.


COPILOT_NODE_COMMAND ~

Use this field to provide the path to a specific node version such as one
installed by nvm. Node.js version must be 20 or newer.

Example:

>lua
    copilot_node_command = vim.fn.expand("$HOME") .. "/.config/nvm/versions/node/v20.0.1/bin/node", -- Node.js version must be > 20
<


SERVER_OPTS_OVERRIDES ~

Override copilot lsp client settings. The `settings` field is where you can set
the values of the options defined in SettingsOpts.md <./SettingsOpts.md>. These
options are specific to the copilot lsp and can be used to customize its
behavior. Ensure that the name field is not overridden as is is used for
efficiency reasons in numerous checks to verify copilot is actually running.
See |vim.lsp.start| for list of options.

Example:

>lua
    require("copilot").setup {
      server_opts_overrides = {
        trace = "verbose",
        settings = {
          advanced = {
            listCount = 10, -- #completions for panel
            inlineSuggestCount = 3, -- #completions for getCompletions
          }
        },
      }
    }
<


WORKSPACE_FOLDERS ~

Workspace folders improve Copilot’s suggestions. By default, the root_dir is
used as a workspace_folder.

Additional folders can be added through the configuration as such:

>lua
    workspace_folders = {
      "/home/user/gits",
      "/home/user/projects",
    }
<

They can also be added runtime, using the command `:Copilot workspace add
[folderpath]` where `[folderpath]` is the workspace folder.


ROOT_DIR ~

This allows changing the function that gets the root folder, the default looks
for a parent folder that contains the folder `.git`. If none is found, it will
use the current working directory.


SHOULD_ATTACH ~

This function is called to determine if copilot should attach to the buffer or
not. It is useful if you would like to go beyond the filetypes and have more
control over when copilot should attach. You can also use it to attach to
buflisted buffers by simply omitting that portion from the function. Since this
happens before attaching to the buffer, it is good to prevent Copilot from
reading sensitive files.

An example of this would be:

>lua
    require("copilot").setup {
      should_attach = function(_, bufname)
        if string.match(bufname, "env") then
          return false
        end
    
        return true
      end
    }
<


SERVER ~


  [!CAUTION] `"binary"` mode is still very much experimental, please report any
  issues you encounter.
`type` can be either `"nodejs"` or `"binary"`. The binary version will be
downloaded if used.

`custom_server_filepath` is used to specify the server path (filename included)
of either the `js` file if using `"nodejs"` or to the binary if using
`"binary"`. The filename on its own can also be set if accessible through your
PATH. When using `"binary"`, the download process will be disabled and the
binary will be used directly. example:

>lua
    require("copilot").setup {
      server = {
        type = "nodejs",
        custom_server_filepath = "/home/user/copilot-lsp/language-server.js",
      },
    }
<

FAQ                                                  *copilot-copilot.lua-faq*


  Certificate Parsing Error
This is an issue with the copilot lsp itself as described in this discussion
<https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/136273#discussioncomment-10433527>.
Please update the plugin to the latest version to solve this issue. If updating
does not help, some users have reported that updating the
`/usr/bin/update-ca-trust` and removing the –comment option from the trust
extract commands solves the issue. However this has not been verified by the
author of this plugin and may have unintended consequences so thread with care.


  Multiple offset encodings warning
As discussed in #247, the problem arises because two or more clients are using
different offset encodings. To solve this, in lspconfig:

>lua
    local capabilities = vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities() -- Get The capabilities
    capabilities.general.positionEncodings = { "utf-16" } -- Set the offset encoding, see `:h vim.lsp.start` for more info
    require("lspconfig")[server].setup({ capabilities = capabilities }) -- Setup the server
<

Set the same for copilot in `server_opts_overrides`:

>lua
    server_opts_overrides = {
      offset_encoding = "utf-16" -- Set the offset encoding same as above, see `:h vim.lsp.start` for more info
    }
<

Refer to your plugins documentation for changes.
